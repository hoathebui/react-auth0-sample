# Auth0 React Sample Application

This sample demonstrates the following use cases:

- [Login](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-react-samples/blob/master/Sample-01/src/components/NavBar.js#L72-L79)
- [Logout](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-react-samples/blob/master/Sample-01/src/components/NavBar.js#L102-L108)
- [Showing the user profile](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-react-samples/blob/master/Sample-01/src/views/Profile.js)
- [Protecting routes](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-react-samples/blob/master/Sample-01/src/views/Profile.js#L33)
- [Calling APIs](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-react-samples/blob/master/Sample-01/src/views/ExternalApi.js)

## Project setup

Use `yarn` to install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

### Create an API

For the ["call an API"](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react/02-calling-an-api) page to work, you will need to [create an API](https://auth0.com/docs/apis) using the [management dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis). This will give you an API identifier that you can use in the `audience` configuration field below.

If you do not wish to use an API or observe the API call working, you should not specify the `audience` value in the next step. Otherwise, you will receive a "Service not found" error when trying to authenticate.

### Configure credentials

The project needs to be configured with your Auth0 domain and client ID in order for the authentication flow to work.

To do this, first copy `src/auth_config.json.example` into a new file in the same folder called `src/auth_config.json`, and replace the values with your own Auth0 application credentials, and optionally the base URLs of your application and API:

```json
{
  "domain": "{YOUR AUTH0 DOMAIN}",
  "clientId": "{YOUR AUTH0 CLIENT ID}",
  "audience": "{YOUR AUTH0 API_IDENTIFIER}",
  "appOrigin": "{OPTIONAL: THE BASE URL OF YOUR APPLICATION (default: http://localhost:3000)}",
  "apiOrigin": "{OPTIONAL: THE BASE URL OF YOUR API (default: http://localhost:3001)}"
}
```

**Note**: Do not specify a value for `audience` here if you do not wish to use the API part of the sample.

## Run the sample

### Compile and hot-reload for development

This compiles and serves the React app and starts the backend API server on port 3001.

```bash
npm run dev
```
